# TF-Hub Object Detection

This repository is created to reproduce experiments on object detection with powerful tool TF-Hub, which includes hundreds of pre-trained models (https://tfhub.dev).

The notebook containes two examples of pre-trained models used for object detection:

* FasterRCNN+InceptionResNet V2 (with high accuracy);
* ssd+mobilenet V2 (less accuracy, but small and fast);

Object recognition is tested on few paintings of Vincent van Gogh. Source of the images: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki

This notebook is based on Tensorflow Tutorial, which is available at the following link: https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/object_detection
